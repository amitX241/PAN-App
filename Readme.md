## Running the code
Amit please fill it

## Input
- For input to the code here we have used an input text file named accountfile.txt which consist of pan numbers, name, address in a comma separated manner.
- The program reads through each line and stores all the pan number, corresponding name and address in a object which is later used for hashing and storing in hash table.
- For hashing we are only using the pan number.

## Output
- The program is mainly about storing Pan numbers in hash table and searching if the given Pan number is available in the hash table.
- Therefore we are using another file named findaccountfile.txt which consist of Pan numbers to be searched.
- Other outputs like menu, found or not, hashing results are shown in the console itself.
